## Summary
### Drawbacks and Recommendations
One drawback of the webpage is the length of the table at times. The webpage would benefit from the option to either collapse and expand the table or the option to decide the number of entries per page of results.
To further develop the webpage, adding a calendar and a date format to the "Enter Date" parameter would be beneficial to users. Adding the ability to search for a date range to the date filter would also give users more flexibility. The ability to sort the columns of the results table would also make using the webpage easier for users.
